## Requirements
- Grand Theft Auto V for the PC
- [ScriptHookV](http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/)
- [ScriptHookVDotNet](https://github.com/crosire/scripthookvdotnet/releases)

## Installation
1. Install ScriptHookV
2. Create a `scripts` folder in your GTA game directory (same place as the GTA exe)
3. Download the latest release of Kill Counter from [here](https://github.com/DavidShefcik/GTA-kill-counter-mod/releases)
4. Drag `KillCounter.dll` into the `scripts` folder
5. Start GTA

## Usage
- The counter resets when the player respawns at a hospital. Currently that is detected when the user loses $5,000 but I will fix that later to be more accurate
- Manually reset the counter with the `X` key
